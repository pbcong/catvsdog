#Cat_vs_Dog_Classifier

Welcome to the Cat vs Dog Classifier, a deep learning model designed to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The h5 file for the trained model can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Y7Z2-ClZQDPMfCvyj0sbDi3OGSKqbxG/view?usp=sharing)

I used the TensorFlow data pipeline for efficient loading and preprocessing of the dataset. 

The model was build using a Convolutional Neural Network that result in an accuracy of 99.8%.

Data was collected from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data?select=train.zip)
