#Cat vs Dog Classifier

Welcome to the Cat vs Dog Classifier, a deep learning model designed to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. 

I used the TensorFlow data pipeline for efficient loading and preprocessing of the dataset. 

The model was build using a Convolutional Neural Network.

Data was collected from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data?select=train.zip
